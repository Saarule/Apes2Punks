# Apes2Punks

Apes 2 Punks are dynamic, on-chain generated, evolutional NFTs. The Apes are living on the blockchain and evolving as time passes. The NFT's image is dynamic and changes as the Ape evolves into a Punk. The price is also dynamic and with every mint call on the smart contract, the price is increasing by 10%. It is a self-contained mechanism for generating NFTs.

This project was built for the EthGlobal 'Road to Web3' 2022 hackathon.
